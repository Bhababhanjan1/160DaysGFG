The provided code calculates the **maximum profit** from a series of stock prices, allowing multiple transactions. The idea is to add up the profit for every "uphill" transaction (i.e., when today's price is greater than yesterday's price). Letâ€™s perform a **dry run**.

---

### Example Input:
```java
prices = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4}
```

---

### Initial Values:
- `profit = 0` (tracks total profit).

---

### Step-by-Step Execution:

#### **Iteration 1: `i = 1`**
- Compare `prices[1]` with `prices[0]`: \( 1 < 7 \).
- No profit is made because today's price is lower than yesterday's.
- Updated state:  
  ```plaintext
  profit = 0
  ```

---

#### **Iteration 2: `i = 2`**
- Compare `prices[2]` with `prices[1]`: \( 5 > 1 \).
- Profit is made: \( 5 - 1 = 4 \).
- Add profit to `profit`: \( profit = 0 + 4 = 4 \).
- Updated state:  
  ```plaintext
  profit = 4
  ```

---

#### **Iteration 3: `i = 3`**
- Compare `prices[3]` with `prices[2]`: \( 3 < 5 \).
- No profit is made because today's price is lower than yesterday's.
- Updated state:  
  ```plaintext
  profit = 4
  ```

---

#### **Iteration 4: `i = 4`**
- Compare `prices[4]` with `prices[3]`: \( 6 > 3 \).
- Profit is made: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \).
- Add profit to `profit`: \( profit = 4 + 3 = 7 \).
- Updated state:  
  ```plaintext
  profit = 7
  ```

---

#### **Iteration 5: `i = 5`**
- Compare `prices[5]` with `prices[4]`: \( 4 < 6 \).
- No profit is made because today's price is lower than yesterday's.
- Final state:  
  ```plaintext
  profit = 7
  ```

---

### Final Output:
```java
profit = 7
```

---

### Dry Run Summary:

#### Input:
```plaintext
prices = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4}
```

#### Iterations:
| Day \(i\) | Price \(prices[i]\) | Profit Made | Total Profit |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1         | 1                   | 0           | 0            |
| 2         | 5                   | 4           | 4            |
| 3         | 3                   | 0           | 4            |
| 4         | 6                   | 3           | 7            |
| 5         | 4                   | 0           | 7            |

---

### Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - The algorithm iterates through the `prices` array once: \( O(n) \).

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - Uses a single variable (`profit`) to track profit: \( O(1) \).

---

### Key Points:
- The algorithm ensures that every profitable transaction is added to the total profit.
- It does not require sorting or maintaining additional data structures, making it highly efficient.
