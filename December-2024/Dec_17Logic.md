### Problem Statement
You are tasked with placing `k` cows in `stalls[]` such that the **minimum distance between any two cows** is maximized.

---

### Key Insights
1. **Distance Check**: The minimum distance between cows must be as large as possible. This can be checked for any given distance `mid` by placing cows greedily.
2. **Binary Search**: Instead of trying all possible distances naively (which would be inefficient), we use binary search to determine the largest minimum distance.

---

### Steps to Solve

1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sorting ensures that we can consider the stalls in increasing order to simplify distance checks.

2. **Binary Search on Distance**:
   - The minimum possible distance is `1` (as cows must be in different stalls).
   - The maximum possible distance is `max(stalls) - min(stalls)`.

3. **Greedy Placement**:
   - For a given distance `mid`, check if it’s possible to place all `k` cows such that the minimum distance between any two cows is at least `mid`.
   - Place cows one by one:
     - Start from the first stall.
     - Place the next cow only if the distance from the last placed cow is at least `mid`.

4. **Update Binary Search**:
   - If placing cows is successful with distance `mid`, move to a larger distance (`low = mid + 1`).
   - If not, try a smaller distance (`high = mid - 1`).

5. **Result**:
   - The largest `mid` that allows placing all cows is the answer.

### Pseudocode

```java


class Solution {
    public static int aggressiveCows(int[] stalls, int k) {
        // Step 1: Sort the stalls array
        Arrays.sort(stalls);
        
        // Step 2: Define binary search range
        int low = 1; // Minimum possible distance
        int high = stalls[stalls.length - 1] - stalls[0]; // Maximum possible distance
        int result = 0;
        
        // Step 3: Binary search to find the maximum minimum distance
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2; // Candidate distance
            
            if (canPlaceCows(stalls, k, mid)) {
                result = mid;  // Update result as this distance works
                low = mid + 1; // Try for a larger minimum distance
            } else {
                high = mid - 1; // Reduce the search space
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    // Helper method to check if cows can be placed with at least 'minDist' distance
    private static boolean canPlaceCows(int[] stalls, int k, int minDist) {
        int cowsPlaced = 1; // Place the first cow in the first stall
        int lastPosition = stalls[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < stalls.length; i++) {
            if (stalls[i] - lastPosition >= minDist) {
                cowsPlaced++; // Place another cow
                lastPosition = stalls[i]; // Update the last position
            }
            if (cowsPlaced >= k) {
                return true; // Successfully placed all cows
            }
        }
        return false; // Could not place all cows with the given distance
    }
}

```

### Explanation of Code
1. **`canPlaceCows` Function**:
   - Checks if we can place `k` cows in `stalls` such that the minimum distance between them is at least `min_dist`.
   - It uses a greedy strategy to place cows.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - `low` starts at `1` and `high` starts at `stalls[-1] - stalls[0]`.
   - `mid` is the candidate minimum distance we are testing.

3. **Result Update**:
   - If `canPlaceCows` returns `True`, it means we can place the cows with at least `mid` distance. We try for a larger distance.
   - If it returns `False`, we try a smaller distance.

### Complexity Analysis
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Sorting the stalls: \( O(n \log n) \)
   - Binary search range: \( O(\log(max\_distance)) \)
   - Checking placement for each mid: \( O(n) \)

   Total: \( O(n \log n + n \log(max\_distance)) \), where \( n \) is the number of stalls.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - \( O(1) \) (constant extra space).

Let's **dry run** the provided code with a sample input to understand the step-by-step execution.

---

### Input:
```java
int[] stalls = {1, 2, 4, 8, 9};
int k = 3;
```

---

### Step 1: Sort the Stalls Array
The stalls array is already sorted:
```
stalls = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]
```

---

### Step 2: Define Binary Search Range
- `low = 1` (minimum possible distance between two stalls)
- `high = stalls[stalls.length - 1] - stalls[0] = 9 - 1 = 8`

---

### Step 3: Binary Search to Find the Maximum Minimum Distance

#### Iteration 1:
- `mid = (low + high) / 2 = (1 + 8) / 2 = 4`
- Call `canPlaceCows(stalls, k = 3, minDist = 4)`.

**Greedy Placement for `minDist = 4`**:
- Place the **1st cow** at `stalls[0] = 1` (first stall).
- Check next stalls:
    - `stalls[1] = 2`: Distance `2 - 1 = 1` (< 4), skip.
    - `stalls[2] = 4`: Distance `4 - 1 = 3` (< 4), skip.
    - `stalls[3] = 8`: Distance `8 - 1 = 7` (≥ 4), place the **2nd cow** here.
    - `stalls[4] = 9`: Distance `9 - 8 = 1` (< 4), skip.
- **Cows placed = 2**, which is less than `k = 3`.

**Result**:
- `canPlaceCows` returns `false`.
- Update `high = mid - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.

---

#### Iteration 2:
- `mid = (low + high) / 2 = (1 + 3) / 2 = 2`
- Call `canPlaceCows(stalls, k = 3, minDist = 2)`.

**Greedy Placement for `minDist = 2`**:
- Place the **1st cow** at `stalls[0] = 1` (first stall).
- Check next stalls:
    - `stalls[1] = 2`: Distance `2 - 1 = 1` (< 2), skip.
    - `stalls[2] = 4`: Distance `4 - 1 = 3` (≥ 2), place the **2nd cow** here.
    - `stalls[3] = 8`: Distance `8 - 4 = 4` (≥ 2), place the **3rd cow** here.
- **Cows placed = 3**, which is equal to `k = 3`.

**Result**:
- `canPlaceCows` returns `true`.
- Update `result = mid = 2` and `low = mid + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

---

#### Iteration 3:
- `mid = (low + high) / 2 = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3`
- Call `canPlaceCows(stalls, k = 3, minDist = 3)`.

**Greedy Placement for `minDist = 3`**:
- Place the **1st cow** at `stalls[0] = 1` (first stall).
- Check next stalls:
    - `stalls[1] = 2`: Distance `2 - 1 = 1` (< 3), skip.
    - `stalls[2] = 4`: Distance `4 - 1 = 3` (≥ 3), place the **2nd cow** here.
    - `stalls[3] = 8`: Distance `8 - 4 = 4` (≥ 3), place the **3rd cow** here.
- **Cows placed = 3**, which is equal to `k = 3`.

**Result**:
- `canPlaceCows` returns `true`.
- Update `result = mid = 3` and `low = mid + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.

---

### Step 4: Termination Condition
The binary search ends when `low > high`. In this case:
- `low = 4`, `high = 3`.

The maximum minimum distance is stored in `result`, which is **3**.

---

### Final Output:
```
3
```

---

### Summary of Placement Steps:
- **Distance 4**: Not enough cows can be placed.
- **Distance 2**: Cows can be placed, but we search for a larger minimum distance.
- **Distance 3**: Cows can be placed, and it’s the largest feasible distance.
