Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 87.6%Submissions: 859+Points: 2
Given two integer arrays rowSum[] of size n and colSum[] of size m, the task is to construct a 2D matrix of size n x m such that the sum of matrix elements in ith row is rowSum[i] and the sum of matrix elements in jth column is colSum[j].
Note: Since multiple answers are possible, return any one of them. 
Arrays are generated such that answer is always possible.
The driver code will print true if output matrix is correct, otherwise it will print false.

Examples:

Input: rowSum[] = [5, 7, 10], colSum[] = [8, 6, 8]
Output: true
Explanation: For the matrix [[0, 5, 0], [6, 1, 0], [2, 0, 8]], we have row 1 with sum equal to 5 and column 1 has sum equal to 8.Row 2 has sum equal to 7 and column 2 has sum equal to 6.Row 3 has sum equal to 10 and column 3 has sum equal to 8.
Input: rowSum[] = [1, 0], colSum[] = [1]
Output: true
Explanation: For the matrix [[1], [0]], we have row 1 with sum equal to 1 and column 1 has sum equal to 1.Row 2 with sum equal to 0.
Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 103
1 <= rowSum[i] <= 103
1 <= colSum[i] <= 103. 


// Solution:

class Solution {
    public int[][] generateMatrix(int[] rowSum, int[] colSum) {
        int n = rowSum.length;
        int m = colSum.length;
        int[][] matrix = new int[n][m];

        // Fill the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                // Take the minimum of rowSum[i] and colSum[j]
                int value = Math.min(rowSum[i], colSum[j]);
                matrix[i][j] = value;
                rowSum[i] -= value;
                colSum[j] -= value;
            }
        }

        return matrix;
    }
}
