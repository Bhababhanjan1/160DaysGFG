### **Approach:**

The goal is to determine if it is possible for a person to attend all meetings without any overlap between them. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Sort the Meetings by Start Time:**
   - First, sort the array `arr[][]` based on the starting time of each meeting (`arr[i][0]`).
   - Sorting ensures that we process meetings in the order they occur.

2. **Check for Overlapping Meetings:**
   - Iterate through the sorted array and check if the end time of the current meeting (`arr[i][1]`) overlaps with the start time of the next meeting (`arr[i+1][0]`).
   - If `arr[i][1] > arr[i+1][0]`, it indicates an overlap, and the person cannot attend both meetings. Return `false` in this case.

3. **Return Result:**
   - If the loop completes without finding any overlaps, return `true`, indicating that all meetings can be attended.

### **Code:**
```java
class Solution {
    static boolean canAttend(int[][] arr) {
        // Sort the meetings by start time
        Arrays.sort(arr, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0])); 
        
        // Check for overlapping meetings
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i][1] > arr[i + 1][0]) { 
                return false; // Overlap found
            }
        }
        return true; // No overlaps
    }
}
```

### **Dry Run:**

#### **Example 1:**
**Input:** `arr[][] = [[1, 4], [10, 15], [7, 10]]`

1. **Step 1:** Sort the array by start time.
   - After sorting: `[[1, 4], [7, 10], [10, 15]]`

2. **Step 2:** Check for overlaps:
   - Compare `arr[0][1] = 4` with `arr[1][0] = 7` → No overlap (`4 ≤ 7`).
   - Compare `arr[1][1] = 10` with `arr[2][0] = 10` → No overlap (`10 ≤ 10`).

3. **Step 3:** No overlaps found, return `true`.

**Output:** `true`

---

#### **Example 2:**
**Input:** `arr[][] = [[2, 4], [9, 12], [6, 10]]`

1. **Step 1:** Sort the array by start time.
   - After sorting: `[[2, 4], [6, 10], [9, 12]]`

2. **Step 2:** Check for overlaps:
   - Compare `arr[0][1] = 4` with `arr[1][0] = 6` → No overlap (`4 ≤ 6`).
   - Compare `arr[1][1] = 10` with `arr[2][0] = 9` → Overlap found (`10 > 9`).

3. **Step 3:** Overlap found, return `false`.

**Output:** `false`

### **Time Complexity:**
1. Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of meetings.
2. The loop to check overlaps runs in \(O(n)\).
3. Overall time complexity: \(O(n \log n)\).

### **Space Complexity:**
- Sorting uses \(O(1)\) extra space if in-place sorting is used.
- Overall space complexity: \(O(1)\).
