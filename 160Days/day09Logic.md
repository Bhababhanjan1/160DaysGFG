Let’s perform a dry run of the provided code, which aims to minimize the height difference between the tallest and shortest towers after modifying each tower’s height by a given value `k`.




# java
```java
class Solution {
    int getMinDiff(int[] arr, int k) {
        // Step 1: Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int n = arr.length;

        // Step 2: Initialize the difference between the tallest and shortest tower
        int result = arr[n - 1] - arr[0];

        // Step 3: Smallest and largest heights after modification
        int smallest = arr[0] + k;
        int largest = arr[n - 1] - k;

        // Step 4: Traverse the array and compute the minimum difference
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int currentMax = Math.max(arr[i] + k, largest);
            int currentMin = Math.min(arr[i + 1] - k, smallest);

            // Ensure heights remain non-negative
            if (currentMin < 0) continue;

            // Update the result with the minimum difference found
            result = Math.min(result, currentMax - currentMin);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### Example Input:
```java
arr = {1, 5, 8, 10}, k = 2
```

---

### Initial Values:
- The array `arr = {1, 5, 8, 10}`.
- `k = 2`.
- We need to modify the heights of each tower by either adding or subtracting `k` and then minimize the difference between the tallest and shortest tower.

---

### Step-by-Step Execution:

#### **Step 1: Sort the Array**
- Sort the array in ascending order.
- Sorted array: `arr = {1, 5, 8, 10}`.

#### **Step 2: Initialize the Initial Difference**
- `n = arr.length = 4` (the number of towers).
- `result = arr[n - 1] - arr[0] = 10 - 1 = 9`.  
  The initial difference between the tallest and shortest tower is 9.

#### **Step 3: Modify the Smallest and Largest Heights**
- `smallest = arr[0] + k = 1 + 2 = 3`.
- `largest = arr[n - 1] - k = 10 - 2 = 8`.

#### **Step 4: Traverse the Array and Compute the Minimum Difference**
- We will iterate through the array and compute the possible new tallest and shortest towers after modifying their heights. The idea is to minimize the difference between the new tallest and shortest towers.

---

**Iteration 1: `i = 0`**
- `arr[i] = 1` and `arr[i + 1] = 5`.
- Calculate `currentMax` and `currentMin`:
  - `currentMax = Math.max(arr[i] + k, largest) = Math.max(1 + 2, 8) = 8`.
  - `currentMin = Math.min(arr[i + 1] - k, smallest) = Math.min(5 - 2, 3) = 3`.
- Ensure `currentMin` is non-negative, which it is (`currentMin = 3`).
- Calculate the new difference:  
  `result = Math.min(result, currentMax - currentMin) = Math.min(9, 8 - 3) = 5`.

---

**Iteration 2: `i = 1`**
- `arr[i] = 5` and `arr[i + 1] = 8`.
- Calculate `currentMax` and `currentMin`:
  - `currentMax = Math.max(arr[i] + k, largest) = Math.max(5 + 2, 8) = 8`.
  - `currentMin = Math.min(arr[i + 1] - k, smallest) = Math.min(8 - 2, 3) = 3`.
- Ensure `currentMin` is non-negative, which it is (`currentMin = 3`).
- Calculate the new difference:  
  `result = Math.min(result, currentMax - currentMin) = Math.min(5, 8 - 3) = 5`.

---

**Iteration 3: `i = 2`**
- `arr[i] = 8` and `arr[i + 1] = 10`.
- Calculate `currentMax` and `currentMin`:
  - `currentMax = Math.max(arr[i] + k, largest) = Math.max(8 + 2, 8) = 10`.
  - `currentMin = Math.min(arr[i + 1] - k, smallest) = Math.min(10 - 2, 3) = 3`.
- Ensure `currentMin` is non-negative, which it is (`currentMin = 3`).
- Calculate the new difference:  
  `result = Math.min(result, currentMax - currentMin) = Math.min(5, 10 - 3) = 5`.

---

### Final Result:
- After all iterations, the minimum possible difference between the tallest and shortest towers is **5**.

### Dry Run Summary:

#### Input:
```plaintext

```

#### Iterations:
| i  | `arr[i]` | `arr[i+1]` | `currentMax` | `currentMin` | New Difference | `result` |
|----|----------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| 0  | 1        | 5          | 8            | 3            | 5              | 5        |
| 1  | 5        | 8          | 8            | 3            | 5              | 5        |
| 2  | 8        | 10         | 10           | 3            | 5              | 5        |

#### Final Output:
```plaintext
result = 5
```

### Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - Sorting the array takes \( O(n \log n) \).
   - The loop to compute the minimum difference takes \( O(n) \).
   - Overall time complexity: \( O(n \log n) \).

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is \( O(1) \). The sorting function uses \( O(n) \) space in the worst case (for certain implementations), but the algorithm does not explicitly use additional space beyond that.

---

### Key Points:
- The algorithm efficiently minimizes the height difference by sorting the array and adjusting the towers.
- Sorting allows easy access to the smallest and largest towers, while the loop ensures that we account for all potential modifications.
