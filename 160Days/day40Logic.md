### Implementation in Java:
To solve the problem of searching for a number \( x \) in a strictly sorted 2D matrix, we can use **binary search**. This approach is efficient because the matrix's sorted properties allow us to treat it as a 1D array.

---

### **Approach:**

1. **Matrix Properties**:
   - Each row is sorted in strictly increasing order.
   - The first element of row \( i \) is greater than the last element of row \( i-1 \).
   - This makes the matrix effectively a flattened sorted array when treated as a single list.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Treat the matrix as a 1D array of size \( n \times m \).
   - Use two pointers, \( l = 0 \) (start of the "array") and \( r = n \times m - 1 \) (end of the "array").
   - Compute the middle index \( mid \) as \( mid = (l + r) / 2 \).
   - Convert \( mid \) into 2D matrix coordinates:
     - Row: \( mid / m \)
     - Column: \( mid \% m \)
   - Compare the value at \( mat[mid / m][mid \% m] \) with \( x \):
     - If it equals \( x \), return **true**.
     - If it is smaller, move \( l \) to \( mid + 1 \).
     - If it is larger, move \( r \) to \( mid - 1 \).
   - Continue until \( l > r \). If the loop ends without finding \( x \), return **false**.

3. **Complexity**:
   - Time Complexity: \( O(\log(n \times m)) \) since binary search divides the search space in half at each step.
   - Space Complexity: \( O(1) \), as no additional space is used.

---

### **Algorithm**:
1. Initialize \( l = 0 \), \( r = n \times m - 1 \).
2. While \( l \leq r \):
   - Compute \( mid = (l + r) / 2 \).
   - Get the value \( val = mat[mid / m][mid \% m] \).
   - Compare \( val \) with \( x \).
     - If \( val == x \), return **true**.
     - If \( val < x \), set \( l = mid + 1 \).
     - If \( val > x \), set \( r = mid - 1 \).
3. Return **false** if \( x \) is not found.

---

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] mat, int x) {
        int n = mat.length, m = mat[0].length, l = 0, r = n * m - 1;
        while (l <= r) {
            int mid = (l + r) / 2, val = mat[mid / m][mid % m];
            if (val == x) return true;
            if (val < x) l = mid + 1;
            else r = mid - 1;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

Let's dry run the given code step by step with a concrete example to better understand how it works. This code is used to search for an element \( x \) in a 2D matrix \( mat \), where each row of the matrix is sorted, and the last element of each row is smaller than the first element of the next row. 

We'll use the following example:

### Matrix (\( mat \)):
\[
mat = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3 & 5 \\
7 & 9 & 11 \\
13 & 15 & 17
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Target (\( x \)):
Let's set \( x = 9 \).

---

### Dry Run:

1. **Initialization**:
   - \( n = 3 \) (number of rows)
   - \( m = 3 \) (number of columns)
   - \( l = 0 \), \( r = 8 \) (\( n \times m - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8 \))

2. **First Iteration**:
   - \( mid = (l + r) / 2 = (0 + 8) / 2 = 4 \)
   - \( val = mat[mid / m][mid \% m] = mat[4 / 3][4 \% 3] = mat[1][1] = 9 \)
   - Compare \( val \) with \( x \):
     - \( val == x \), so the function returns **true**.

The target \( 9 \) is found in the matrix at position \( mat[1][1] \).

---

### Try with Another Target (\( x = 10 \)):

1. **Initialization**:
   - \( l = 0 \), \( r = 8 \)

2. **First Iteration**:
   - \( mid = (l + r) / 2 = (0 + 8) / 2 = 4 \)
   - \( val = mat[1][1] = 9 \)
   - Compare \( val \) with \( x \):
     - \( val < x \), so \( l = mid + 1 = 5 \)

3. **Second Iteration**:
   - \( mid = (l + r) / 2 = (5 + 8) / 2 = 6 \)
   - \( val = mat[2][0] = 13 \)
   - Compare \( val \) with \( x \):
     - \( val > x \), so \( r = mid - 1 = 5 \)

4. **Third Iteration**:
   - \( mid = (l + r) / 2 = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5 \)
   - \( val = mat[1][2] = 11 \)
   - Compare \( val \) with \( x \):
     - \( val > x \), so \( r = mid - 1 = 4 \)

5. **Exit**:
   - \( l > r \), so the loop ends, and the function returns **false**.

The target \( 10 \) is not found in the matrix.

---

### Conclusion:

The code effectively uses binary search on the flattened representation of the matrix, where the index \( mid \) is converted to 2D coordinates using \( mid / m \) (row index) and \( mid \% m \) (column index). It works efficiently with a time complexity of \( O(\log(n \times m)) \).
