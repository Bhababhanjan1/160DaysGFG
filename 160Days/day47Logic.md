### **Approach:**

To solve the problem of finding the longest consecutive subsequence, we can use a **HashSet** to store all elements of the array. This approach works because a HashSet allows for efficient lookup operations. Here's the breakdown of the steps:

1. **Store all elements in a HashSet:**  
   - We use a HashSet to store all the numbers in the array. This ensures that there are no duplicates, and it allows for constant time lookups to check if an element is present.

2. **Iterate through the HashSet:**  
   - For each element `num` in the HashSet, check if `num - 1` exists in the set.
   - If `num - 1` is not present, it means that `num` is the start of a new possible sequence.

3. **Count the length of the sequence starting from `num`:**  
   - From `num`, check if `num + 1`, `num + 2`, etc., are present in the set.
   - Continue this process until you reach a number that is not in the set, and keep track of the length of this sequence.

4. **Update the longest sequence length:**  
   - After checking the sequence starting from `num`, update the `longest` variable to store the maximum length of the consecutive subsequence found.

5. **Return the longest subsequence length:**  
   - The result is the length of the longest consecutive subsequence found.

### **Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        // Initialize a HashSet to store unique elements
        HashSet<Integer> numSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : nums) numSet.add(num);  // Add all elements to the set
        
        int longest = 0;
        
        // Iterate through the HashSet
        for (int num : numSet) {
            // Check if 'num - 1' is not in the set, implying 'num' is the start of a sequence
            if (!numSet.contains(num - 1)) {
                int count = 1;
                // Keep checking the next consecutive numbers
                while (numSet.contains(++num)) count++;  // Increment the number and count the length of the sequence
                // Update the longest sequence length
                longest = Math.max(longest, count);
            }
        }
        return longest;  // Return the longest length
    }
}
```

### **Dry Run:**

#### **Example 1:**

**Input:**
```java
arr[] = [2, 6, 1, 9, 4, 5, 3]
```

**Execution:**

1. **Step 1: Store elements in the HashSet.**
   - `numSet = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}`

2. **Step 2: Iterate through each number in `numSet`.**

   - Start with `num = 1`:
     - `num - 1 = 0` is not in the set, so `1` is the start of a new sequence.
     - Count the consecutive numbers:
       - `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` are found consecutively in the set.
       - The sequence length is 6.
     - Update `longest = 6`.

   - Next, `num = 2`:
     - `num - 1 = 1` is in the set, so we skip this number since it's already part of a previous sequence.

   - Next, `num = 3`:
     - `num - 1 = 2` is in the set, so we skip this number as well.

   - Similarly, for `num = 4`, `num = 5`, and `num = 6`, they are all part of the previous sequence.

   - Finally, `num = 9`:
     - `num - 1 = 8` is not in the set, so `9` is the start of a new sequence.
     - But `num + 1 = 10` is not in the set, so the sequence length is 1.
     - `longest` remains 6.

3. **Step 3: Return the longest sequence length.**  
   - The longest sequence length found is `6`.

**Output:**
```java
6
```

#### **Example 2:**

**Input:**
```java
arr[] = [1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2]
```

**Execution:**

1. **Step 1: Store elements in the HashSet.**
   - `numSet = {1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 20}`

2. **Step 2: Iterate through each number in `numSet`.**

   - Start with `num = 1`:
     - `num - 1 = 0` is not in the set, so `1` is the start of a new sequence.
     - Count the consecutive numbers:
       - `2`, `3`, `4` are found consecutively in the set.
       - The sequence length is 4.
     - Update `longest = 4`.

   - Next, `num = 2`, `num = 3`, and `num = 4` are skipped since they are already part of the previous sequence.

   - Next, `num = 9`:
     - `num - 1 = 8` is not in the set, so `9` is the start of a new sequence.
     - But `num + 1 = 10` is in the set, so the sequence length is 2.
     - `longest` remains 4.

   - Similarly, `num = 10` and `num = 20` are processed.

3. **Step 3: Return the longest sequence length.**  
   - The longest sequence length found is `4`.

**Output:**
```java
4
```

### **Time Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array. We are iterating through the array once and performing constant time operations for each element in the HashSet.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) due to the space used by the HashSet to store the elements of the array.

This solution is optimal for large inputs because it leverages the HashSet for fast lookups and ensures each element is processed only once.
