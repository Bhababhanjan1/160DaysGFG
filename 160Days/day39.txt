Search in a row-wise sorted matrix
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 51.77%Submissions: 14K+Points: 2
Given a row-wise sorted 2D matrix mat[][] of size n x m and an integer x, find whether element x is present in the matrix.
Note: In a row-wise sorted matrix, each row is sorted in itself, i.e. for any i, j within bounds, mat[i][j] <= mat[i][j+1].

Examples :

Input: mat[][] = [[3, 4, 9],[2, 5, 6],[9, 25, 27]], x = 9
Output: true
Explanation: 9 is present in the matrix, so the output is true.
Input: mat[][] = [[19, 22, 27, 38, 55, 67]], x = 56
Output: false
Explanation: 56 is not present in the matrix, so the output is false.
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 9],[65, 69, 75]], x = 91
Output: false
Explanation: 91 is not present in the matrix.
Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 1000
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 105
1 <= x <= 105

    // Function to search a given number in a row-wise sorted matrix.
    public boolean searchRowMatrix(int[][] mat, int x) {
        // Get the dimensions of the matrix
        int n = mat.length;    // number of rows
        int m = mat[0].length; // number of columns
        
        // Iterate over each row and perform binary search
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (binarySearch(mat[i], x)) {
                return true; // Element found
            }
        }
        
        return false; // Element not found

        int low = 0, high = row.length - 1;

            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            
            if (row[mid] == target) {
                return true;
            } else if (row[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return false; // Target not found in this row
    }
