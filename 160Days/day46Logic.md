### **Approach:**

To find the number of elements in the union of two arrays, we can use a **HashSet**. The steps involved are:

1. **Initialize a HashSet:**  
   A HashSet is used because it automatically ensures that only unique elements are stored (i.e., duplicates are not added).

2. **Add elements from both arrays to the HashSet:**  
   Traverse both arrays (`a[]` and `b[]`), adding each element to the HashSet. If an element is already present, it won't be added again, ensuring that only unique elements are stored.

3. **Return the size of the HashSet:**  
   The size of the HashSet will give the number of distinct elements that are present in the union of the two arrays.

### **Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public static int findUnion(int[] a, int[] b) {
        // Initialize a HashSet to store unique elements
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Add elements of array a to the set
        for (int num : a) set.add(num);
        
        // Add elements of array b to the set
        for (int num : b) set.add(num);
        
        // Return the size of the set, which is the number of unique elements
        return set.size();
    }
}
```

### **Dry Run:**

#### **Example 1:**

**Input:**
```java
a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b[] = [1, 2, 3]
```

**Execution:**

1. **Step 1: Initialize the HashSet.**  
   `set = {}`

2. **Step 2: Traverse Array `a`:**
   - Add 1 to the set: `set = {1}`
   - Add 2 to the set: `set = {1, 2}`
   - Add 3 to the set: `set = {1, 2, 3}`
   - Add 4 to the set: `set = {1, 2, 3, 4}`
   - Add 5 to the set: `set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`

3. **Step 3: Traverse Array `b`:**
   - Add 1 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
   - Add 2 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
   - Add 3 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`

4. **Step 4: Return the size of the set:**  
   The size of the set is 5, which represents the number of unique elements in the union of the arrays.

**Output:**
```java
5
```

#### **Example 2:**

**Input:**
```java
a[] = [85, 25, 1, 32, 54, 6]
b[] = [85, 2]
```

**Execution:**

1. **Step 1: Initialize the HashSet.**  
   `set = {}`

2. **Step 2: Traverse Array `a`:**
   - Add 85 to the set: `set = {85}`
   - Add 25 to the set: `set = {85, 25}`
   - Add 1 to the set: `set = {85, 25, 1}`
   - Add 32 to the set: `set = {85, 25, 1, 32}`
   - Add 54 to the set: `set = {85, 25, 1, 32, 54}`
   - Add 6 to the set: `set = {85, 25, 1, 32, 54, 6}`

3. **Step 3: Traverse Array `b`:**
   - Add 85 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {85, 25, 1, 32, 54, 6}`
   - Add 2 to the set: `set = {85, 25, 1, 32, 54, 6, 2}`

4. **Step 4: Return the size of the set:**  
   The size of the set is 7, which represents the number of unique elements in the union of the arrays.

**Output:**
```java
7
```

#### **Example 3:**

**Input:**
```java
a[] = [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]
b[] = [2, 2, 1, 2, 1]
```

**Execution:**

1. **Step 1: Initialize the HashSet.**  
   `set = {}`

2. **Step 2: Traverse Array `a`:**
   - Add 1 to the set: `set = {1}`
   - Add 2 to the set: `set = {1, 2}`
   - Add 1 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {1, 2}`
   - Add 1 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {1, 2}`
   - Add 2 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {1, 2}`

3. **Step 3: Traverse Array `b`:**
   - Add 2 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {1, 2}`
   - Add 2 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {1, 2}`
   - Add 1 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {1, 2}`
   - Add 2 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {1, 2}`
   - Add 1 to the set (but it's already in the set): `set = {1, 2}`

4. **Step 4: Return the size of the set:**  
   The size of the set is 2, which represents the number of unique elements in the union of the arrays.

**Output:**
```java
2
```

### **Time Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity for adding elements to HashSet:** \(O(a.size + b.size)\)
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(a.size + b.size)\) due to storage in HashSet.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(a.size + b.size)**, where `a.size` and `b.size` are the lengths of the input arrays.
