Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 31.32%Submissions: 155K+Points: 2
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring with all distinct characters. 

Examples:

Input: s = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 7
Explanation: "eksforg" is the longest substring with all distinct characters.
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 1
Explanation: "a" is the longest substring with all distinct characters.
Input: s = "abcdefabcbb"
Output: 6
Explanation: The longest substring with all distinct characters is "abcdef", which has a length of 6.
Constraints:
1<= s.size()<=3*104
All the characters are in lowercase













class Solution {
    public int longestUniqueSubstr(String s) {
        // HashMap to store the last occurrence of each character
        HashMap<Character, Integer> lastSeen = new HashMap<>();
        int maxLength = 0; // Variable to keep track of the maximum length
        int start = 0; // Start of the sliding window

        for (int end = 0; end < s.length(); end++) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(end);

            // If the character is already in the map and its last occurrence is within the current window
            if (lastSeen.containsKey(currentChar) && lastSeen.get(currentChar) >= start) {
                start = lastSeen.get(currentChar) + 1; // Move the start to the next character
            }

            // Update the last occurrence of the character
            lastSeen.put(currentChar, end);

            // Update the maximum length
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
